### From both sides of the Gulf of Bothnia

Mezzosoprano Ylva Gruen and Ristilä are performing with Finnish and Swedish co-operational spirit. The program consists of songs by Finnish composers with Swedish poems, and Swedish songs with Finnish poems. Confused? Don't worry, it's good old Sibelius, Stenhammar and Kilpinen, spiced up with a brand new jazzy cycle of songs from Johannes Pollak.

### ESMO Easter

The greatest opera company in Eastern Finland, ESMO ry, are having a fundraising concert for Easter. There will be plenty of music from really serious Easter composers such as Bach and Händel, but we will have joyful music, too. Because that's what Easter is about.

- __2.4__ 3 pm __Savonlinna church__, Pappilankatu 8, Savonlinna

<br/>

### Sisters take the stage

In her final recital, baroque recorder player Hanna Ristilä performs a dance suite with her sister Jenna. There will be plenty of dance indeed, thrills and laments, as baroque goes.

- __19.4__ 12 am __Helsinki conservatory of music__, Ruoholahdenkatu 6, Helsinki

<br/>

### Night and dream

Soprano Anna-Maija Oka and Ristilä have created a world of night and dreams. Through the music of Purcell, Barber and others - not forgetting hits from musicals - they tell stories of the empress of the night, moon; dying soldiers, lovers seeking a place to hide,... Slipped between the songs there is all kinds of information on the same topics. But how?

- __22.4__ 2 pm __Järvenpää museum of art__, Kirjastokatu 8, Järvenpää
