### Songs and Spring

Jenna Ristilä performs with soprano Leena Kanninen in two concerts. The first is a fundraising event for a choir Leena is conducting. The program includes songs and piano music by Sibelius, of course, to celebrate his 150th anniversary. The second concert is in preparation for Leena's master's recital. She will sing some fascinatingly strange, rarely performed Melartin songs, and some ever-glorious Strauss. Come hear!
