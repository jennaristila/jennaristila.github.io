### Once upon a time in Kalevala

To celebrate Finland's 100th anniversary, the Lahti Opera Association is producing a piano version Pohjanneiti, an opera by Oskar Merikanto. Based on the Finnish national epoch, Kalevala, the opera is an adventure story of two conflicting nations; one woman torn between two suitors; and, of course, true love.
Ristilä is the director of music and the performance pianist in the production.
