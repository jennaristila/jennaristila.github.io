## 2016

<br/>

I'm taking a short break from performing - preparing for Start-up Opera is the priority now. Welcome to our show in March!

<br/>

### Start-up Opera presents: Jääkausi

Have you ever wanted to know how an opera is made from scratch? Ristilä and Itzam Zapata have founded the Start-up Opera group, who are creating and performing a new operatic work. You can follow the group's progress from [startupopera.blogspot.fi](http://startupopera.blogspot.fi/).

- Premiere __1.3.2016__ at 7 pm __Camerata Hall__, Musiikkitalo, Helsinki
