## Biography

Jenna Ristilä (b. 1989) began her piano studies at the age of 7 in Savonlinna Music School, where her teacher was Anja Ojanen-Forsberg. In 2006 she was accepted to the Sibelius Academy Youth Department, and a year later to the Department of Performing Arts, with Hamsa Juris and Teppo Koivisto as her teachers. In spring 2014 Ristilä graduated as a master of music, receiving the highest grade from her master's recital. She is grateful to the Finnish Cultural Foundation and the ProMusica Foundation for their support.  

In 2010-2011 Ristilä was an exchange student at the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama in Cardiff. Solo playing was momentarily cast aside as Ristilä collaborated intensely with the vocal music department. She studied lied with Michael Pollock, worked as an assisting opera coach in two opera productions, and accompanied numerous concerts, auditions and master classes.

Ristilä performs regularly as a soloist, accompanist and chamber musician. Her passion is vocal music, because the variety of possible projects with singers is so huge. In 2014 Ristilä released a Christmas cd with coloratura soprano Johanna Lehesvuori, and in 2015 they were finalists in Helsinki Lied -competition. With ESMO ry, lead by Joonas Asikainen, Ristilä has performed opera in Eastern Finland: 2014 Telephone opera by Menotti received praise, and last summer it was Humperdinck's Hensel and Gretel's turn. Ristilä and composer Itzam Zapata founded the Start-up Opera group, and it's first premiere, Jääkausi, was in the Soiva Akatemia concert series in March 2016. Ristilä also writes the group's [blog](http://startupopera.blogspot.fi).

Currently Ristilä studies opera coaching at the Sibelius Academy, is the artistic director of Start-up Opera, and teaches at [Keski-Vantaa Music School](http://kevamo.com/) and Tuusulan Kansalaisopisto. In Summer Ristilä can be found in Savonlinna, working as a pianist and musical director in Savonlinna Opera Festival's Red Riding Hood -children's opera.
