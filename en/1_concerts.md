### Around Finland we go

Soprano Sanna Matinniemi and Ristilä are travelling here and there in Finland during the summer. They're performing some of the most loved songs by Finnish composers with folk songs on the side, and a bit of Sibelius piano music. What's not to love? The exact times and places will be announced during spring.

- __6.7 Pyhäjärvi__
- __14.7 Kiuruvesi__

### From both sides of the Gulf of Bothnia

Mezzosoprano Ylva Gruen and Ristilä are performing with Finnish and Swedish co-operational spirit. The program consists of songs by Finnish composers with Swedish poems, and Swedish songs with Finnish poems. Confused? Don't worry, it's good old Sibelius, Stenhammar and Kilpinen, spiced up with a brand new jazzy cycle of songs from Johannes Pollak.

### Chamber music wonders

Ristilä is one of the rehearsal pianists in Savonlinna Music Academy's chamber music course. The busy week will include recitals in Melartin hall and art galleries. Violin, viola, cello and clarinet music is heard all around town, so come and enjoy the very special Savonlinna summer atmosphere!

### Topelius Now!

A brand new children's opera based on the fairytales of Topelius, Finland's storytelling giant. Soprano Mari Karjalainen and baritone Joonas Asikainen fill the stage with hilarious characters, while Ristilä eats popcorn behind the piano (for real. Come and see!) The music is a mix of famous classical tunes and Mika Siekkinen's new music, arranged by Ristilä. Topelius Now! will be touring schools in Southern and Eastern Finland during autumn.

### Helsinki Lied

Ristilä and mezzosoprano Ylva Gruen are always on the lookout for new adventures, and now they're going to compete. Helsinki Lied Competition with its inspiringly free program is making the duo work, work, work throughout the summer!
