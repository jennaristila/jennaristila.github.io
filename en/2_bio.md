## Biography

Jenna Ristilä (b. 1989) began her piano studies at the age of 7 in Savonlinna Music School, where her teacher was Anja Ojanen-Forsberg. In 2006 she was accepted to the Sibelius Academy Youth Department, and a year later to the Department of Performing Arts, with Hamsa Juris and Teppo Koivisto as her teachers. In spring 2014 Ristilä graduated as a master of music, receiving the highest grade from her master's recital. She is grateful to the Finnish Cultural Foundation and the ProMusica Foundation for their support.  

In 2010-2011 Ristilä was an exchange student at the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama in Cardiff. Solo playing was momentarily cast aside as Ristilä collaborated intensely with the vocal music department. She studied lied with Michael Pollock, worked as an assisting opera coach in two opera productions, and accompanied numerous concerts, auditions and master classes.

Ristilä performs regularly as a soloist and accompanist. Currently she studies opera coaching at the Sibelius Academy and teaches at [Keski-Vantaa Music School](http://kevamo.com/). Her summer is filled with chamber music and preparation for Merikanto's opera Pohjanneiti, but whenever visiting her hometown Savonlinna, Ristilä makes sure she has time to eat the local delicacies - vendace and "lörtsy" - and to swim.

__Those who look back__ -solo recitals were built around the Handel Variations by Brahms. Ristilä fell in love with the work and combined it with Villa-Lobos and Shostakovich, and the program was done! All the pieces had elements of baroque, which united the seemingly unrelated men.

__Hansel and Gretel -children's opera__ was a shortened version of Humperdinck's real deal that Esmo ry performed in Savonlinna during the summer. Ristilä was directing the music and Jenny Jumppanen staging, and on stage there were plenty of familiar faces from around Savonlinna: Joonas Asikainen, Anu Ontronen, Päivi Pylvänäinen, Maiju Vaahtoluoto et al.
