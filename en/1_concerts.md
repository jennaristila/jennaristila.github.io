### Once upon a time in Kalevala

To celebrate Finland's 100th anniversary, the Lahti Opera Association is producing a piano version Pohjanneiti, an opera by Oskar Merikanto. Based on the Finnish national epoch, Kalevala, the opera is an adventure story of two conflicting nations; one woman torn between two suitors; and, of course, true love.
Ristilä is the director of music and the performance pianist in the production.

- Premiere __14.10__ 7 pm __Pikkuteatteri__, Loviisankatu 8, Lahti
- Other performances __17.10, 18.10, 20.10, 7.11, 8.11__
