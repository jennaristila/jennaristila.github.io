## Biography

Jenna Ristilä (b. 1989) is a Finnish pianist. She mostly works with singers, but also performs chamber music and solo repertoire. Ristilä has worked as a music director and pianist in several operas for both adults and children, and she always gets excited about planning lied programs – but she’s just as comfortable while coaching singers, recording or competing. Ristilä is fascinated by contemporary music and she has premiered several works, including the song cycle Guldgrävarens tårar by Johannes Pollak (with mezzosoprano Ylva Gruen), and the chamber opera Jääkausi by Itzam Zapata (with the Start-up Opera group she founded). In addition to her artistic work, Ristilä teaches in [Keski-Vantaa Music School](http://kevamo.com).

In 2014 Ristilä graduated as a master of music from the Department of Performing Arts at the Sibelius Academy, and in 2018 she completed her second masters degree at the same university, this time with vocal coaching as her major. 2010-2011 Ristilä was an exchange student at the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama in Cardiff. Her most significant teachers include Teppo Koivisto, Ilmo Ranta and Anja Ojanen-Forsberg, and she has studied classical singing and harpsichord as well as piano.

__Oskar Merikanto's opera Pohjan neiti__ was performed by Lahti Opera Association as a piano version. Ristilä was the production's musical director and pianist, and got great reviews for her work.

"The orchestration of the opera has been often criticised. Now it couldn't be judged, because Jenna Ristilä at the piano played the whole accompaniment so magnificiently, that one didn't have to feel sorry for not having an orchestra present." (Veijo Murtomäki, HS 15.10)

__Comic Opera Helsinki lied concert series__ had soprano Johanna Lehesvuori and Ristilä perform a program of American vocal and piano music.

__Those who look back__ -solo recitals were built around the Handel Variations by Brahms. Ristilä fell in love with the work and combined it with Villa-Lobos and Shostakovich, and the program was done! All the pieces had elements of baroque, which united the seemingly unrelated men.

__Hansel and Gretel -children's opera__ was a shortened version of Humperdinck's real deal that Esmo ry performed in Savonlinna during the summer. Ristilä was directing the music and Jenny Jumppanen staging, and on stage there were plenty of familiar faces from around Savonlinna: Joonas Asikainen, Anu Ontronen, Päivi Pylvänäinen, Maiju Vaahtoluoto et al.
