## 2018

<br/>

### Sisters take the stage

In her final recital, baroque recorder player Hanna Ristilä performs a dance suite with her sister Jenna. There will be plenty of dance indeed, thrills and laments, as baroque goes.

- __19.4__ 1 pm __Helsinki conservatory of music__, Ruoholahdenkatu 6, Helsinki

<br/>

### Night and dream

Soprano Anna-Maija Oka and Ristilä have created a world of night and dreams. Through the music of Purcell, Barber and others - not forgetting hits from musicals - they tell stories of the empress of the night, moon; dying soldiers, lovers seeking a place to hide,... Slipped between the songs there is all kinds of information on the same topics. But how?

### Around Finland we go

Soprano Sanna Matinniemi and Ristilä are travelling here and there in Finland during the summer.

### From both sides of the Gulf of Bothnia

Mezzosoprano Ylva Gruen and Ristilä are performing with Finnish and Swedish co-operational spirit. The program consists of songs by Finnish composers with Swedish poems, and Swedish songs with Finnish poems. Confused? Don't worry, it's good old Sibelius, Stenhammar and Kilpinen, spiced up with a brand new jazzy cycle of songs from Johannes Pollak.
