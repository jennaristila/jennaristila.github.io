## Biography

Jenna Ristilä (b. 1989) began her piano studies at the age of 7 in Savonlinna Music School, where her teacher was Anja Ojanen-Forsberg. In 2006 she was accepted to the Sibelius Academy Youth Department, and a year later to the Department of Performing Arts, with Hamsa Juris and Teppo Koivisto as her teachers. Ristilä graduated as a master of music in spring 2014 receiving the highest grade from her master's recital. She is grateful to the Finnish Cultural Foundation and the ProMusica Foundation for their support.  


Ristilä has done all kinds of musical things: participated in piano competitions in Finland and in Denmark; performed as a soloist, accompanist and chamber musician; studied singing; released a Christmas cd with Johanna Lehesvuori; fallen for music analysis; and completed a degree in instrumental pedagogy.


In 2010-2011 Ristilä was an exchange student at the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama in Cardiff. Solo playing was momentarily cast aside as Ristilä collaborated intensely with the vocal music department. She studied lied with Michael Pollock, worked as an assisting opera coach in two opera productions, and accompanied numerous concerts, auditions and master classes.


Currently Ristilä studies opera coaching at the Sibelius Academy and teaches at [Keski-Vantaa Music School](http://kevamo.com/) and Tuusulan Kansalaisopisto. This summer will bring opera performances in Savonlinna and some solo concerts. The most important goal, however, is to finish the pair of woollen socks she's been knitting since... a long time ago.
